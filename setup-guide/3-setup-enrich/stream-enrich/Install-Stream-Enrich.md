**This documentation is for version 0.15.x-0.20.x of Stream Enrich. Documentation for other versions is available:**

**[Version 0.11.0-0.14.0][v0.14]**  
**[Version 0.6.0-0.10.0][v0.10]**

## 1. Dependencies

You will need version 8 (aka 1.8) of the Java Runtime Environment installed.

## 2. Getting the jar

You can choose to either:

1. Download the Stream Enrich jarfile, _or:_
2. Compile it from source

### 2.1 Download the jarfile

To get a local copy, you can download the executable jarfile directly from our Hosted Assets bucket
on Amazon S3 - please see our [[Hosted assets]] page for details.

### 2.2 Compile from source

Alternatively, you can build it from the source files. To do so, you will need [scala][scala] and
[sbt][sbt] installed.

To do so, clone the Snowplow repo:

	$ git clone https://github.com/snowplow/snowplow.git

Navigate into the Stream Enrich folder:

	$ cd 3-enrich/stream-enrich

Use `sbt` to resolve dependencies, compile the source, and build an [assembled][assembly] fat JAR
file with all dependencies.

	$ sbt "project [targeted platform]" assembly

Where targeted platform can be one of:

- kinesis
- kafka
- nsq
- stdin

The JAR file will be saved as `snowplow-stream-enrich-[targeted platform]-[version].jar` in the
`[targeted platform]/target/scala-2.11` subdirectory - it is now ready to be deployed.
